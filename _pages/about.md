<h2>about me</h2>
I am a third-year PhD student (since Fall 2021) from the <a href="https://maps-lab.github.io/" target="_blank">MAPS Lab</a> at the University of Edinburgh, sponsored by the <a href="https://www.edinburgh-robotics.org/" target="_blank">EPSRC CDT in Robotics and Autonomous Systems</a>, supervised by <a href="https://christopherlu.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Chris Xiaoxuan Lu</a> and <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/bwebb/" target="_blank">Prof. Barbara Webb</a>. My expertise lies in developing spatial, semantic and motion perception systems for **embodied AI**, encompassing mobile robots, autonomous vehicles, VR/AR and IoT devices. At the core of my research is exploiting, the mmWave imaging radar and thermal camera sensors, to cope with **robustness** challenges and **privacy** concerns found in mobile autonomy perception, and human sensing and modelling.

Before coming to Edinburgh, I received my B.Eng degree with the highest honour - <a href="https://news.tongji.edu.cn/info/1003/76035.htm?ivk_sa=1023197a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Academic Star</a> in 2020 from <a href="https://en.tongji.edu.cn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tongji University</a> (2017-2021).

<!-- where I worked in the <a href="https://vision4robotics.github.io/" target="_blank">V4R lab</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Changhong-Fu" target="_blank">Dr. Changhong Fu</a>. In August 2020, I visited Tsinghua University and conducted on-site research under the supervison of <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38237039900" target="_blank">Dr. Geng Lu</a>.  -->
ðŸ‘‰ I am looking for self-motivated UG/Ms students to work with on **cutting-edge** research projects on 
-  Thermal Camera-based Scene Completion for Autonomous Driving  
-  mmWave Modality Comprehension with Large Language Model
-  Multi-Modal Dataset for Versatile Perception of Embodied AI

Support in the form of computational and sensory tools, robot platform, alongside practical supervision and direction, is available. 

ðŸ‘‰ I am actively looking for a research intern position this year. Shoot me an email if you think I am a good fit!
