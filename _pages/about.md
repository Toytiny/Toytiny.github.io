<h2>about me</h2>
I am a third-year PhD student from the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh, sponsored by the <a href="https://www.edinburgh-robotics.org/" target="_blank">EPSRC CDT in Robotics and Autonomous Systems</a>, supervised by <a href="https://christopherlu.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Chris Xiaoxuan Lu</a> and <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/bwebb/" target="_blank">Prof. Barbara Webb</a>. My research focuses on advancing the robustness, efficiency, and privacy-aware capability of perception systems for **embodied AI**. This encompasses applications in mobile robots, autonomous vehicles, IoT and xR-integrated systems, aiming to facilitate their **widespread, long-term and non-intrusive** deployment in the wild. Currently, my works mainly involve the mmWave imaging radar and thermal camera sensors, leveraging their unique sensing resilience to cope with **adverse weather and illumination** conditions. I am also keen to incorporate full-spectral multi-modal fusion into my research field.

Before coming to Edinburgh, I received my B.Eng degree with the highest honour - <a href="https://news.tongji.edu.cn/info/1003/76035.htm?ivk_sa=1023197a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Academic Star</a> and awarded double National Scholarships from <a href="https://en.tongji.edu.cn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tongji University</a> (2017-2021).

<!-- where I worked in the <a href="https://vision4robotics.github.io/" target="_blank">V4R lab</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Changhong-Fu" target="_blank">Dr. Changhong Fu</a>. In August 2020, I visited Tsinghua University and conducted on-site research under the supervison of <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38237039900" target="_blank">Dr. Geng Lu</a>.  -->
ðŸ‘‰ I am looking for self-motivated UG/Ms students to work with on **cutting-edge** research projects on 
-  Thermal Camera-based Scene Completion for Autonomous Driving  
-  mmWave Modality Comprehension Powered by Large Language Model
-  Efficient Dynamic Scene Mapping with Tightly Coupled Multi-Modal Fusion

Support in the form of computational and sensory tools, robot platform, alongside practical supervision and direction, is available. 

ðŸ‘‰ I am actively looking for a research intern position this year. Shoot me an email if you think I am a good fit!
