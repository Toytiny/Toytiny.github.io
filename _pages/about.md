<h2>about me</h2>
I am a third-year PhD student (since Fall 2021) from the <a href="https://maps-lab.github.io/" target="_blank">MAPS Lab</a> at the University of Edinburgh, sponsored by the <a href="https://www.edinburgh-robotics.org/" target="_blank">EPSRC CDT in Robotics and Autonomous Systems</a>, supervised by <a href="https://christopherlu.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Chris Xiaoxuan Lu</a> and <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/bwebb/" target="_blank">Prof. Barbara Webb</a>. My research interests lie in robust spatial, semantic and motion perception for mobile robotics, and generalizable, privacy-aware and multi-perspective human behaviour recognition. My recent representative work is *4D Automotive Radar-enabled Mobile Autonomy*, using the emerging 4D radar imaging technology to improve the perception redundancy, robustness and efficency onboard autonomous vehicles.  

Before coming to Edinburgh, I received my B.Eng degree with the highest honour - <a href="https://news.tongji.edu.cn/info/1003/76035.htm?ivk_sa=1023197a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Academic Star</a> (top 10 out of all UG students) in 2020 from <a href="https://en.tongji.edu.cn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tongji University</a> (2017-2021) in Shanghai. My previous research interests include UAV visual tracking & localization, 3D object detection & tracking, etc. 

<!-- where I worked in the <a href="https://vision4robotics.github.io/" target="_blank">V4R lab</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Changhong-Fu" target="_blank">Dr. Changhong Fu</a>. In August 2020, I visited Tsinghua University and conducted on-site research under the supervison of <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38237039900" target="_blank">Dr. Geng Lu</a>.  -->
ðŸ‘‰ I am looking for UG/Ms students to work with on cutting-edge research projects, within but not limited to the areas of my research interests.

ðŸ‘‰ I am actively looking for a research intern position this year. Shoot me an email if you think I am a good fit!
